# antgraph
This software, developed as a thesis project for a Bachelor in Computer Science, is 
an interactive JS application intended to be used as a didactic tool for showing the essential
behaviors from the biological model that inspired Ant Colony Optimization algorithms.
The application exploits the ACO meta-heuristic to implement and run
simulations of a colony of ants moving in a graph-shaped environment.

The user can draw a graph, set up various algorithm parameters and see the emergent behaviour
of ants moving through the graph, and to which path they possibly converge. The
fine-grained tuning of the involved parameters is particularly important to show how much
ACO algorithms depends on the parameter setting. 
Two variants of exploration algorithms are defined,
but the architecture of the software has been designed to support the definition of more
variants of the basic algorithm.
